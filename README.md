# Building Deep Learning from Scratch (NumPy Only)

> "I don't trust Black Boxes. I build to understand."

### 🚧 Project Status: Under Construction

I am re-implementing core Deep Learning algorithms (Affine layers, Backpropagation, Optimizers) using only NumPy, without relying on frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
This is my journey to decode the mathematics behind AI.
